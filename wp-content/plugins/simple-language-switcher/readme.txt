A simple and lightweight plugin that displays a customizable language switcher.

== Description ==

Simple Language Switcher is a simple and lightweight plugin that allows you to display a language switcher on your site.

= Features =

* You can easily customize the display of your language switcher (language ISO codes, language names or flags).
* Interconnect your post in different languages (avoids the user to be redirected to the home page when switching to another language).
* Current language detection with regex: avoids displaying a link to the same page in the same language.
* Generates rel="alternate" hreflang="x" links for SEO purposes.
